I"º<p>This page is made to show some audio samples of our proposed method.</p>

<p>Our proposed method include the phase continuity information in training, thus improve speech quality, intelligibility, and reconstruction.</p>

<p>The large variety of test dataset (4 types of SNRs, 5 types of noise) and small network size made large standard deviation, so the performance of samples differs a lot.</p>

<p>So we provided 3 types of samples; better, similar, and worse samples compare to the baseline and baseline with basic phase loss.</p>
