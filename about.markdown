This page is made to show some audio samples of our proposed method.

Our proposed method include the phase continuity information in training, thus improve speech quality, intelligibility, and reconstruction. 

The large variety of test dataset (4 types of SNRs, 5 types of noise) and small network size made large standard deviation, so the performance of samples differs a lot. 

So we provided 3 types of samples; better, similar, and worse samples compare to the baseline and baseline with basic phase loss.
